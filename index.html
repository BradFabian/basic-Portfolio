                        To your stations! Come with me. Close all outboard shields! Close 
                        all outboard shields! Yes. 
                        We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. 
                        It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. They must be trying to 
                        return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. Unlock one-five-seven and nine. 
                        Release charges. There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right 
                        after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
                        We don't serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. 
                        Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir.
                        Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn't like you. I'm sorry. I don't like you either You just watch 
                        yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I'll be careful than.
                        You'll be dead. This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...
                        Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. Look, sir -- droids.
                        I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Go on, go on. I can't understand how we 
                        got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
                         You will find it a powerful ally. Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us 
                         to Alderaan? Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place 
                         can be a little rough. I'm ready for anything. Come along, Artoo.
                        What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at
                         Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always.
